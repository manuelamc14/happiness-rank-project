# What Makes Us Smile: World Happiness Data at a Glance

Hypothesis: GDP is positively related to happiness level.

Null hypothesis: GDP is not related to the happiness level

Analyzed the data provided by Kaggle.com to create a Jupyter notebook using Pandas, Matplotlib and other statistic tests. Our goal was to gather enough data for the year 2020 relating to happiness levels and run tests to prove the validity of our hypothesis; GDP is positively related to happiness level. The data consists of several variables that can influence happiness levels; GDP per capita, Life Expectancy, Social Support, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity and Perceptions of Corruption for over 150 countries. The list of countries was split into ten different geographic regions. 


After reviewing the data to see which factors have an influence on Happiness, we decided to focus on GDP. Our main analysis was to see if there is a positive relationship between GDP and happiness levels for each country. We researched and asked questions mostly related towards GDP and happiness level.


Below are the questions we answered in the Jupyter notebook using tests and visualizations:

# Research Questions:

1. Do the countries of the same region have the same level of happiness?

Plotted bar graphs to show the happiness scores for five regions.

2. Do all of the variables have an equal effect on the happiness level of regions?

Plotted heat maps to show the correlation between the variables (GDP, social support, health life expectancy, freedom to make choices, and generosity) and the overall happiness level. 

3. How do the countries with the highest GDP compare in terms of happiness level versus the countries with the lowest GDP?

Plotted two box-and-whisker plots to compare the happiness of higher-GDP countries and lower-GDP countries.

4. What portion of high-GDP countries have low happiness levels?

Plotted pie chart to show the percentage of high-GDP countries with low happiness levels.

5. What portion of low-GDP countries have high happiness levels?

Plotted pie chart to show the percentage of low-GDP countries with high happiness levels.


# Conclusion:

After performing various statistic tests and plotting visualizations we can confirm that we have enough evidence to support our hypothesis and state it is true. We can confirm, GDP does have a positive relationship to the happiness level. We have accepted the hypothesis and rejected the null hypothesis.
