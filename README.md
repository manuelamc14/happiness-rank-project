# What Makes Us Smile: World Happiness Data at a Glance

Hypothesis: GDP is positively related to happiness level.

Null hypothesis: GDP is not related to the happiness level

Analyzed the data provided by Kaggle.com to create a Jupyter notebook using Pandas, Matplotlib and other statistic tests. Our goal was to gather enough data for the year 2020 relating to happiness levels and run tests to prove the validity of our hypothesis; GDP is positively related to happiness level. The data consists of several variables that can influence happiness levels; GDP per capita, Life Expectancy, Social Support, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity and Perceptions of Corruption for over 150 countries. The list of countries was split into ten different geographic regions. 


After reviewing the data to see which factors have an influence on Happiness, we decided to focus on GDP. Our main analysis was to see if there is a positive relationship between GDP and happiness levels for each country. We researched and asked questions mostly related towards GDP and happiness level.


Below are the questions we answered in the Jupyter notebook using tests and visualizations:
